# Wordle-bot
A bot that solves wordle word of the day

First it will ask you if you want to save your attempt you can answer yes or no. It just puts your attempt in to a txt file

Than if you would like to start with a random word also answer yes or no. I don't realy know how well the random works.
if you say yes it will start with a random wordle from the wordle dictionary

If you say no it will ask you if you want to start with your own word if yes you can type in your own word but it has to be in the dictionary.
If you say no it will give you the word "alert" becouse i said so.

You than type in the word you were given of chose in to wordle and see what letters are yellow green or not apart of the word.
You than give than type that info in to the program

y(if letter is yello)
g(if letter is green)
n(if letter is not in the word)

example:

Save attempt (yes) (no):no

Start with random word (yes) (no):no

Start with your own word (yes) (no):no

alert // you are given this word

nnnyg // you type in the information *IMPORTANT" IT HAS TO BE ALL TOGETHER IN ONE STRING

brunt // you are given the next word to type in

nyyng 

strut

ggggg // the program stops since it has guessed the word
